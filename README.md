GOODIE (GOOgle Docs Interview Editor) connects a local editor (e.g,
Emacs) with Google Docs.  Our goal was to simplify (for us and others)
the interviews with the companies (e.g., Google) that use Google Docs
to communicate with the candidates.

GOODIE started at Midwest Regional Hackathon on November 09, 2013.
